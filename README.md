# AutoRegressive_model_cs

## Building an auto regressive model from Scratch in c#

Getting your hands-on by building from scratch a linear regression model and AR model through MCO:

- Class Matrix creating a matrix object and containing all useful methods (multiplication, inverse, transpose, factorisation LU, resolving linear system...)
- Class Linear regression: computing the regressors through MCO, returning errors and t-stats 
- Class Spot Price prediction :  an example on using an AR model instance in a real case
